# Release Notes - OCPP 1.6 Server v2.2.0

**Release Date:** January 16, 2025  
**Type:** Minor Release (Feature Enhancement)  
**Previous Version:** v2.1.1

## 🎯 Overview

OCPP 1.6 Server v2.2.0 is a minor release that introduces significant UI improvements for better charger management and enhanced multi-charger testing capabilities. This release focuses on scalability and user experience improvements for managing multiple charging stations simultaneously.

## ✨ New Features

### Enhanced UI Design
- **Improved Charger List Display**: Better spacing and visual hierarchy for charger status items
- **Vertical Scrolling**: Fixed-height charger list that displays 5 chargers at a time with smooth scrolling
- **Professional Styling**: Enhanced visual appearance with proper padding, borders, and badge styling
- **Scalable Interface**: UI now gracefully handles large numbers of connected chargers

### Multi-Charger Testing Improvements
- **OCPP-Compliant Heartbeats**: Heartbeat intervals now properly follow server response from BootNotification
- **Continuous Operation**: Test chargers now run indefinitely with proper heartbeat cycles
- **Scale Testing**: Enhanced support for testing up to 20+ concurrent charger connections
- **Server-Controlled Timing**: Heartbeat intervals dynamically set by server response instead of hardcoded values

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Charger List Enhancements
- **Fixed Height Container**: Charger list now has a max height to show exactly 5 chargers at once
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Vertical scrollbar appears when more than 5 chargers are connected
- **Better Information Layout**: Improved spacing for charger ID, status, last seen time, and connection badges
- **Enhanced Visual Hierarchy**: Better typography and spacing for easier scanning of charger information
- **Professional Badges**: Consistent sizing and styling for connection status indicators

### Responsive Design
- **Scalable Layout**: UI adapts well to different numbers of connected chargers
- **Improved Readability**: Better contrast and spacing for status information
- **Clean Interface**: Reduced visual clutter with improved element positioning

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Multi-Charger Testing
- **OCPP Protocol Compliance**: Heartbeat behavior now follows OCPP 1.6 specification
- **Dynamic Interval Management**: Each charger uses server-provided heartbeat interval from BootNotification response
- **Persistent Connections**: Test chargers maintain continuous WebSocket connections
- **Concurrent Testing**: Enhanced support for testing multiple chargers simultaneously (tested with 20 chargers)

### Backend Enhancements
- **Improved Connection Handling**: Better management of multiple concurrent WebSocket connections
- **Enhanced Status Tracking**: More accurate status reporting for multiple connected chargers
- **Performance Optimization**: Better handling of high-frequency heartbeat messages from multiple chargers

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Multi-Charger Testing
- ✅ Tested with 20 concurrent charger connections
- ✅ Verified OCPP-compliant heartbeat intervals (server-controlled)
- ✅ Confirmed continuous operation without timeout issues
- ✅ Validated proper BootNotification → StatusNotification → Heartbeat flow

### UI Testing
- ✅ Verified proper display of 5 chargers at a time
- ✅ Tested smooth scrolling with 20+ chargers
- ✅ Confirmed proper spacing and visual hierarchy
- ✅ Validated responsive behavior across different screen sizes

### Regression Testing
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Remote commands continue to work correctly
- ✅ Status updates remain accurate
- ✅ Configuration management unchanged

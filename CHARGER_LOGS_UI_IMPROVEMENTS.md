# Charger Logs Window UI Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the charger logs window to provide better user experience with improved height and proper auto-scroll behavior.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Increased Log Window Height**
**Problem**: The charger logs window was too small at 500px height, making it difficult to view logs effectively.

**Solution**: 
- Increased log container height from `500px` to `700px`
- Provides 40% more viewing area for logs
- Better utilization of screen real estate

**File Modified**: `frontend/templates/index.html`
```css
.log-container {
    height: 700px; /* Increased from 500px */
    overflow-y: auto;
    background-color: #f8f9fa;
    padding: 1rem;
    border-radius: 0.25rem;
    font-family: monospace;
}
```

### 2. **Fixed Auto-Scroll Behavior**
**Problem**: When auto-scroll was OFF, new packet updates would still cause the scroll bar to jump to the bottom, disrupting user's current viewing position.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented intelligent scroll position preservation
- When auto-scroll is OFF:
  - Saves current scroll position before updating logs
  - Maintains user's viewing position when new logs arrive
  - Only scrolls to bottom if user was already at the bottom
  - Adjusts scroll position intelligently when new content is added

**File Modified**: `frontend/static/app.js`

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Scroll Position Management
```javascript
// Save current scroll position before updating logs
const savedScrollTop = container.scrollTop;
const savedScrollHeight = container.scrollHeight;
const wasAtBottom = (savedScrollTop + container.clientHeight) >= (savedScrollHeight - 10);

// After updating logs:
if (autoScrollEnabled) {
    // Auto-scroll ON: always scroll to bottom
    container.scrollTop = container.scrollHeight;
} else {
    // Auto-scroll OFF: preserve position or intelligently adjust
    if (wasAtBottom) {
        container.scrollTop = container.scrollHeight;
    } else {
        // Maintain relative scroll position with new content compensation
        const scrollDifference = newScrollHeight - savedScrollHeight;
        container.scrollTop = savedScrollTop + scrollDifference;
    }
}
```

## User Experience Benefits

### **Before Fixes:**
- ❌ Small 500px log window requiring excessive scrolling
- ❌ Auto-scroll OFF still caused unwanted scrolling to bottom
- ❌ Lost viewing position when new logs arrived
- ❌ Frustrating user experience when examining historical logs

### **After Fixes:**
- ✅ Larger 700px log window with better visibility
- ✅ True auto-scroll OFF behavior - position preserved
- ✅ Smart scroll adjustment that maintains context
- ✅ Smooth user experience for both real-time monitoring and log analysis

## Use Cases Improved

1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Auto-scroll ON works as before
2. **Historical Analysis**: Auto-scroll OFF now properly preserves position
3. **Log Investigation**: Users can examine specific logs without losing position
4. **Multi-tasking**: Better screen utilization with larger log window

## Testing Verification

### Test Auto-Scroll OFF Behavior:
1. Turn auto-scroll OFF
2. Scroll to middle or top of logs
3. Wait for new OCPP packets to arrive
4. Verify scroll position is maintained (not jumping to bottom)

### Test Auto-Scroll ON Behavior:
1. Turn auto-scroll ON  
2. Verify new logs automatically scroll to bottom
3. Confirm traditional behavior is preserved

### Test Window Height:
1. Compare log viewing area with previous 500px height
2. Verify improved visibility and reduced need for scrolling
3. Confirm UI proportions remain balanced

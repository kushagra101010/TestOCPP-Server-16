# OCPP 1.6 Server v2.2.0 Release

**🎨 Enhanced UI & Multi-Charger Support**

We're excited to announce **OCPP 1.6 Server v2.2.0**, a minor release that significantly improves the user interface and enhances multi-charger testing capabilities for better scalability.

## 🚀 What's New

### ✨ Enhanced User Interface
- **📏 Smart Scrolling**: Charger list now displays exactly 5 chargers at a time with smooth vertical scrolling
- **🎨 Professional Styling**: Improved spacing, padding, and visual hierarchy for better readability
- **🏷️ Better Badges**: Consistent connection status indicators with professional appearance
- **⚖️ Scalable Design**: UI gracefully handles large numbers of connected chargers (tested with 20+)

### 🔄 OCPP Protocol Improvements

- **🔄 Continuous Operation**: Test chargers maintain persistent connections with proper heartbeat cycles
- **📡 Better Compliance**: Enhanced adherence to OCPP 1.6 protocol specifications

### 🧪 Enhanced Testing Tools
- **📈 Scale Testing**: Updated `test_multiple_chargers.py` to support 20 concurrent charger connections
- **🔗 Persistent Connections**: Test chargers now run indefinitely for better load testing
- **⚡ Dynamic Timing**: Heartbeat intervals dynamically set by server response instead of hardcoded values

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### For Users
- **Better Visibility**: Manage large numbers of charging stations with improved UI
- **Professional Experience**: More polished and user-friendly interface
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Better tools for multi-charger deployment scenarios

### For Developers
- **OCPP Compliance**: More accurate implementation of heartbeat timing
- **Testing Capabilities**: Better tools for scalability and load testing
- **Code Quality**: Cleaner heartbeat interval management logic

## 📊 Technical Improvements

### UI Enhancements
```css
/* New CSS improvements */
#chargerList {
    max-height: 400px;           /* Show exactly 5 chargers */
    overflow-y: auto;            /* Smooth scrolling */
}

.list-group-item {
    padding: 12px 16px;          /* Better spacing */
    border-radius: 8px;          /* Professional appearance */
}

.badge {
    min-width: 90px;             /* Consistent sizing */
}
```

### OCPP Protocol Updates
```python
# Enhanced heartbeat interval management
self.heartbeat_interval = getattr(response, 'interval', 300)

# Continuous operation with server-controlled timing
while True:
    await asyncio.sleep(charge_point.heartbeat_interval)
    await charge_point.send_heartbeat()
```

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- ✅ **Multi-Charger Scale**: Tested with 20 concurrent charger connections
